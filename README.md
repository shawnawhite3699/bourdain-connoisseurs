# The Local Foodie
The Local Foodie is a Austin-based restaurant locator app that allows onlookers to view various restaurants that several famous chefs prefer. You can also see the reviews for every restaurant that was recommended by these celebrity chefs. These featured celebrity chefs include Aaron Franklin, Paul Qui, and Anthony Bourdain. If you want, you can also leave a review yourself to help others decide where to eat! This was a project made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used two API's and made them coincide with each other.

## Project 1 Overview/Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
